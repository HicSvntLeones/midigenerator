This is notes for myself for how I'm naming progressions. Leaving it in just in case someone wants to look at it.

The command string generated by the ProgressionGenerator serves as both the filename, and the instructions for the CommandGenerator.

The first item in the string is always the beginning note, optionally followed by sharp (s) or flat (b).

Immediately following this will be the beginning mode as a three letter string.

"CsMIX" - C# Mixolydian
"EAEO" - E Aeolian (E Minor)
