This is notes for myself for how I'm naming progressions. Leaving it in just in case someone wants to look at it.

The command string generated by the ProgressionGenerator serves as both the filename, and the instructions for the CommandGenerator.

The first item in the string is always the beginning note, optionally followed by sharp (s) or flat (b).

Immediately following this will be the beginning mode as a three letter string.

"CsMIX" - C# Mixolydian
"EAEO" - E Aeolian (E Minor)

Followed by dash-separated roman numerals, representing the progression. An underscore marks the end of the string for interperator purposes.
The filename itself should not include the underscore.
All roman numerals are uppercase.

"CAEO-I-VI-IV-V_" C Aeolian (Major) with I VI IV V progression.

The Root note or Mode can be changed at any time by restating both the root note and the mode immediately following a progression, without the -.

"CAEO-I-V-IIFsMIX-II-III-I_" C Aeolian I V II, followed by F# Mixolydian II II I
